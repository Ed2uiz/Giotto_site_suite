**Giotto Suite** is a suite of software tools, including data structures
and methods, for the comprehensive analysis and visualization of spatial
expression data. It was developed to extend and improve our previous R
package Giotto. This will ensure that our spatial analysis solutions
remain compatible with all current and future developed spatial
technologies and platforms. It will also aid in the further integration
with other external analysis pipelines and tools.

The most important changes and additions are:

  - support for multi-modal datasets (e.g. RNA + Protein)
  - support for subcellular data
      - efficient representations for image information (e.g. nucleus,
        membrane, …)  
      - individual transcript locations
  - image processing tools
      - registration  
      - segmentation  
  - Joint analysis: combining and analyzing multiple spatial datasets  
  - Large file management:
      - DelayedArray
