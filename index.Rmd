<br> 

### latest update: 

```{r echo=F}
Sys.Date()
```



<br>  

## Installation:

You can install Giotto Suite on any platform in 2 easy steps:

#### Step 1: install Giotto Suite
``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("RubD/Giotto@suite") 
```

#### Step 2: install the Giotto python environment
The python environment only needs to be installed once.

``` r
library(Giotto)
installGiottoEnvironment()
```

This command only needs to be run once and then Giotto will automatically detect the environment in the future.  

For more information:   

* See [Installation](https://giottosuite.com/articles/temp_construction.html) for alternative (manual) installation options.  
* See [Giotto Environment](https://giottosuite.com/articles/temp_construction.html) to learn more about the Giotto environment.  
* See [FAQ](https://giottosuite.com/articles/faq.html) for troubleshooting.

## Summary:

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**Giotto Suite** is a suite of software tools, including data structures and methods, for the comprehensive analysis and visualization of spatial expression data. It was developed to extend and improve our previous R package Giotto. This will ensure that our spatial analysis solutions remain compatible with all current and future developed spatial technologies and platforms. It will also aid in the further integration with other external analysis pipelines and tools.

The most important changes and additions are:    

* support for multi-modal datasets (e.g. RNA + Protein) 
* support for subcellular data  
    + efficient representations for image information (e.g. nucleus, membrane, ...)  
    + individual transcript locations
    + subcellular analyses
* image processing tools  
    + registration  
    + segmentation 
    + integration
    + efficient visualization
* Joint analysis: combining, batch correcting and analyzing multiple spatial datasets  
* Large file management:  
    + DelayedArray  
    + terra
