# Giotto and Image Data
<br>
Multiple images can be attached to your Giotto object. Spatial data can be overlaid over these images and the images themselves can also be used for downstream image analyses. While Giotto attempts to automate the addition and alignment of images as much as possible, manual adjustments may sometimes be necessary, and this tutorial will be covering both topics.  
Examples will be worked using Visium's normal human prostate FFPE [dataset](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/normal-human-prostate-ffpe-1-standard-1-3-0) for both the Visium and manual adjustment workflows.  


### Conceptual Overview
Images are loaded in using the [**magick**](https://rdrr.io/cran/magick/) package and then placed into **giottoImage** objects to be worked with in Giotto.

<details>
  <summary>**More about the giottoImage container**</summary>
  <hr>
  **giottoImages** are S4 class objects with slots that contain both the image itself, and all the metadata needed to plot them in the right position. The **magick** package allows easy access to image processing functions and also the ability to refer to images through pointers so that they are only loaded into memory when needed.  
    
  When incorporated into a **giottoObject**, **giottoImages** are added into the **images** slot of the **giottoObject**.  
  The **images** slot is organized as a **list()** so multiple **giottoImages** can be added and then individually referred to by the **name** they are given.  
  <br>
  **giottoImage Structure**  
    - name - *name of the giottoImage*  
    - mg_object - *image loaded in as magick object*  
    - minmax - *x and y minimum and maximum values found from spatial locations\**  
    - boundaries - *adjustment values for how the image should be stretched based on the minmax values*  
    - scale_factor - *scale factor of spatial locations to image*  
    - resolution - *spatial location units covered per pixel*  
    - OS_platform - *computer environment*  
    
  \*Note that **minmax** refers to the relevant values of the associated spatial locations rather than those of the image (either given through providing the spatial locations directly during **createGiottoImage()** or later steps that involve **giottoObjects** with attached spatial locations.)

</details>  
<br>
For maximum flexibility, Giotto plots images and spatial data on different layers that are largely independent of each other. The spatial data is first plotted and then essentially serves as an anchor **(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)** while the image (no matter its actual dimensions or resolution) is **stretched** to fit on the plot according to accompanying metadata **(xmin_adj, xmax_adj, ymin_adj, ymax_adj)** that can be edited by the user.  
<br>
![](../inst/images/getting_started_figs/getting_started_images/images_adjust.png){width=60%}  
  Calling the **giottoImage** by itself will display its class and name followed by what values are in its minmax, boundary adjustment, scale_factor, and resolution slots. The actual image boundaries displaying spatial values for where the image's edges will be stretched to is also displayed.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
An object of class ' giottoImage ' with name  image 
 
Min and max values are: 
 Max on x-axis:  23520 
 Min on x-axis:  5066 
 Max on y-axis:  -3682 
 Min on y-axis:  -23148 
 
Boundary adjustment are:

 Min adjustment on x-axis:  5066 
 Max adjustment on y-axis:  3682 
 Min adjustment on y-axis:  2082.277 
 
Boundaries are: 
 Image x-axis max boundary:  27469 
 Image x-axis min boundary:  0 
 Image y-axis max boundary:  0 
 Image y-axis min boundary:  -25230.28 
 
Scale factor(s) for spatlocs are: 
  raw :  0.07280935 
Resolution(s) for spatlocs are: 
  raw :  13.7345 
```

<br>
Since most spatial datasets currently generate spatial locations based on how they map onto an original image, simplified, Giotto's automatic alignment works as follows:  
- Scale image dimensions to original dimensions by dividing by the **scaling_factor**  
- **xmin_adj** = (spatial location xmin) - 0  
- **xmax_adj** = (xmax image bound in original dimensions) - (spatial location xmax)  
- **ymin_adj** = (spatial location ymin) - (ymin image bound in original dimensions)  
- **ymax_adj** = 0 - (spatial location ymax)  
<br>
  
### Visium workflow only (Automated):
Assembly of Giotto object and reading in and alignment of the tissue staining image from the visium spatial subdirectory is done automatically using **createGiottoVisiumObject()**.


Creation of a giotto object from   
Either the hires or lowres image will be loaded depending on whether "**tissue_hires_image.png"** or **"tissue_lowres_image.png"** is provided to the **png_name** argument.  
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(Giotto)
  
# gobject creation
VisiumDir <- 'path/to/visium/dataset/directory'
FFPE_prostate <- createGiottoVisiumObject(visium_dir = VisiumDir,
                                          "tissue_hires_image.png")

# visualize spots that are in tissue
spatPlot2D(FFPE_prostate, show_image = TRUE,
           cell_color = 'in_tissue')
```

<br>
  
### Standard workflow
#### Step 0 - Inverting Y-Values
Often, the first step is making the y values in your spatial locations negative. This is due to differences in conventions for defining coordinates in images and plotting and is required in order for the spatial locations to appear in the same orientation as your image.  
This transformation of the spatial locations is automatically done for Visium datasets during **createGiottoVisiumObject()**.

<details>
<summary>**Why this is needed**</summary>
<hr>
**Image Coordinates vs Plotting Coordinates**  
The reason for this issue is because image coordinates are defined to start in the upper left by convention and many spatial methods inherit this convention when generating the spatial locations. Giotto plots with the coordinates originating from the lower left, and thus the **spatial locations are displayed as vertically flipped compared to how they are intended to be seen**.
![](../inst/images/getting_started_figs/getting_started_images/images_coord_diffs.png){width=70%}  
**The fix for this is to multiply all the Y-values in spatial locations by -1, inverting them** either prior to creation of the giottoObject or afterwards using the following commands:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
spatlocs <- get_spatial_locations(gobject = my_gobject,
                                  spat_loc_name = my_spatlocs)

spatlocs$sdimy <- -spatlocs$sdimy

my_gobject <- set_spatial_locations(gobject = my_gobject,
                                    spat_loc_name = my_spatlocs,
                                    spatlocs = spatlocs)
```
where g_object refers to your **giottoObject** and my_spatlocs to the name of the **spatial locations** that you want to align the image to.

#### Step 1 - giottoImage Creation

giottoImages are created using the **createGiottoImage()** function. This function requires a **magick**-compatible image (eg. jpg, tiff, png) to be provided to the **mg_object** argument as either a filepath or already loaded in as a **magick** object.  
Also required if automatic image alignment is desired is the **scale_factor** which is the scaling from the spatial locations to the image.  
*This is since spatial locations do not contain information for how large the image is past the spatial xmax and ymin values. Those two image bounds are instead inferred by scaling up the current image dimensions to those of the spatial locations.*  
For Visium datasets, scaling information is available in the **scalefactors_json.json** file found within the **spatial** subdirectory.  
  
**scalefactors_json.json** for this dataset:
```{r eval=FALSE}
{"tissue_hires_scalef": 0.072809346, "tissue_lowres_scalef": 0.021842804, "fiducial_diameter_fullres": 304.63145798068047, "spot_diameter_fullres": 188.58137874994503}
```

(**Optional**) Providing spatial location information through either the **gobject**/**spat_loc_name** or **spatial_locs** argument will populate the minmax and boundary slots in an attempt to auto-align the image with the spatial locations. The auto-alignment can be bypassed by using **do_manual_adj = TRUE** and only the minmax slot will be populated.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
lowRes <- "/path/to/visium/directory/spatial/tissue_lowres_image.png"
lowResG_img <- createGiottoImage(gobject = FFPE_prostate,
                                 mg_object = lowRes,
                                 name = "low_res",
                                 scale_factor = 0.021842804)
```

<br>

#### Step 2 - Add giottoImage to giottoObject and Visualize
**addGiottoImage()** adds a **list** of images to the **giottoObject** specified. The name that the image is referred to as within the **images** slot is inherited from the **name** argument during **createGiottoImage()**. The default name is "image."  
```{r eval=FALSE}
FFPE_prostate = addGiottoImage(gobject = FFPE_prostate, images = list(lowResG_img))

spatPlot2D(gobject = FFPE_prostate,
           show_image = TRUE,
           image_name = "low_res",
           cell_color = "in_tissue")
```
  ![](../inst/images/getting_started_figs/getting_started_images/images_VisAutoAdj_FFPE_prostate_lowres.png){width=50%}  

### Manual Adjustment
Manually adjusting the plotting of images comes either during **createGiottoImage()** using **do_manual_adj = TRUE** and the four adjustment values **(xmin_adj, xmax_adj, ymin_adj, ymax_adj)** or after **giottoImage** creation using **updateGiottoImage()**.  
This method is performed by eye and may be necessary depending on preference or if despite accounting for scaling, the image coordinates do not match up with the spatial coordinates for some reason.  

#### During giottoImage creation
```{r eval=FALSE}
# createGiottoImage with manually defined adjustment values
lowRes <- "/path/to/visium/directory/spatial/tissue_lowres_image.png"
lowResG_img <- createGiottoImage(gobject = FFPE_prostate,
                                 mg_object = lowRes, name = "low_res",
                                 do_manual_adj = TRUE,
                                 xmin_adj = 5066,
                                 xmax_adj = 3949,
                                 ymin_adj = 2078,
                                 ymax_adj = 3682,
                                 scale_factor = 0.021842804)
