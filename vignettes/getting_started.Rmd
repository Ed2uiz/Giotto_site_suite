## HOWTOs 
[under construction]  
 
Giotto provides a lot of analyses, visualizations and other options to facilitate your spatial dataset analysis.
We are working on providing easy-to-understand examples or tutorials, but if anything is not clear or if there is something you
would like to see in particular, then do not hesitate to contact [us](https://github.com/RubD/Giotto/issues).
